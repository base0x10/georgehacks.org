             <h2 class="text-color">OUR MISSION</h2>

             <p>George Hacks is an innovation competition where students compete to develop the best solution for a given need in the medical device market. The theme of our hackathon: Assistive Devices that address the need for affordable devices among patients with disabilities. </p>

             <p>The devices that students attempt to build should aim to be accessible for low to middle income families. Medical equipment companies often do not see affordable medical devices as a profitable market. If a patient does not have health insurance, or if the device is not covered by insurance, patients often seek more affordable options. Many times, affordable options are unavailable or ineffective, resulting in an inability to properly meet patientâ€™s medical needs, and extending recovery time and total expenses. Projects built at George Hacks will cater to several user groups, such as pediatrics or geriatrics, and students will compete to be the top three teams.
